# 🚀🚀🚀 PumpFun Migration Sniper 🚀🚀🚀

A high-performance, TypeScript-based sniper bot designed to automatically detect and purchase tokens the moment they migrate from Pump.Fun to a Pumpswap liquidity pool.

## ⚡ Features

`Real-Time Monitoring`: Listens for Pump.Fun Migrate events on the Solana blockchain.

`Instant Buying`: Automatically submits a buy transaction as soon as the migration is detected and the Pumpswap pool is initialized.

`Priority Fees`: Configurable priority fees to help push transactions through during network congestion.

`RPC Management`: Built-in support for multiple RPC endpoints with fallback logic to avoid rate-limiting.

`Customizable Parameters`: Set your buy amount, allowed mint authority, and other key parameters.

`TypeScript`: Written in TypeScript for better development experience and type safety.


## 📌 Notes & Warnings

⚠ High-risk trading: Sniping can lead to losses (slippage, rugs, failed TXs).

⚠ Use a dedicated wallet: Avoid using your main wallet.

⚠ Optimize RPC: A private RPC reduces latency (essential for sniping).

## 🔄 Advanced Optimizations

Run on a low-latency server (e.g., AWS/GCP in us-west-1).

Preload token metadata in Redis to speed up lookups.

Adjust gas fees dynamically based on network congestion.
